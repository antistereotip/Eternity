Stellar is an open-source network for currencies and payments. 
Stellar makes it possible to create, send and trade digital 
representations of all forms of money—dollars, pesos, bitcoin, 
pretty much anything. It’s designed so all the world’s financial 
systems can work together on a single network.

Stellar has no owner; if anything it’s owned by the public. 
The software runs across a decentralized, open network and handles 
millions of transactions each day. Like Bitcoin and Ethereum, 
Stellar relies on blockchain to keep the network in sync, 
but the end-user experience is more like cash—Stellar is much faster, 
cheaper, and more energy-efficient than typical blockchain-based systems.

And so on...
