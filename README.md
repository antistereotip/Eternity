## Ideology of Blockchain

- Blockchain is the digital, distributed, and decentralized ledger that underpins virtual currencies, which are responsible for completing all transactions without the use of financial intermediaries like banks or brokerages. Many new opportunities and innovations have arisen as a result of blockchain technology. Blockchain has thrived in the economic sector, spawning new possibilities such as DeFi and NFT. As we continue to see widespread adoption of blockchain in the economic sector, the possibility grows.

##### Block
- A collection of data that are usually limited in size or number of data units.

##### Chain
- A collection of blocks linked together by an algorithm that makes use of the previous block's information.

##### Node
- A system that is used to verify the authenticity of blocks as well as to maintain a digital ledger that keeps track of all blocks in chronological order.
